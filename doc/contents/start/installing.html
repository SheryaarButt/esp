            <h1>Installing ESP</h1>
            <p>ESP is available as a source code distribution. Several build environments are supported:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Linux</b> &mdash; Linux 4 or later with GNU C/C++</li>
                <li><b>Windows</b> &mdash; Microsoft Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2019 or later</li>
                <li><b>Mac OS X</b> &mdash; Mac OS X 10.10 or later</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The source code has been designed to run on FreeBSD, Linux, Mac OS X, VxWorks and other operating systems.</p>

            <h2>Accessing the Source Code</h2>
            <p>With each ESP release, a complete source code snapshot is provided. You can download a source package from the ESP web site or you can retrieve it from the ESP GitHub repository. If you download from the repository, please use the <em>master</em> branch for the most recent stable snapshot. For less stable daily builds, use the <em>dev</em> branch.</p>

            <h2>Building ESP from Source</h2>
            <p>The ESP source distribution contains all the required source files, headers, and test framework to reconfigure, build, and verify ESP. The software supports three methods for building from source.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://embedthis.com/makeme/">MakeMe</a></li>
                <li>Visual Studio or Xcode</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Building via <em>make</em> is the simplest way to build. Use <em>make</em> if you want a default build or if you need to integrate ESP with an existing make-based build system. Build with <a href="https://embedthis.com/makeme/">MakeMe</a> if you want to customize or configure the software for your system, or if you need to cross-compile for another operating system or architecture. Use the Visual Studio or Xcode if you are most comfortable with these tools and want a default build.</p>

            <h2>Building</h2>
            <p>We use the <a href="https://embedthis.com/makeme/">MakeMe</a> tool internally to generate the ESP Makefiles, MakeMe and IDE projects. This cool tool generates clean, efficient makefiles and projects. The MakeMe project documents how to use these generated Makefiles and projects as they are the same for all projects that use MakeMe. For full details, read on, courtesy of MakeMe:</p>

            <h2>Essential Tools</h2>
            <p>ESP makes heavy use of two sibling tools from Embedthis.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://embedthis.com/pak/">Pak</a> manager to install and manage extension packages.</li>
                <li><a href="https://embedthis.com/expansive/">Expansive</a> site manager for layout pages
                    and web site tooling.</li>
            </ul>
